On this page, you will find some unstructured information about a coffee shop, including the website navigation, the cafe's name, address, phone number, and a sign-up form. You have 2 tasks:
* Organize all the information on the page using the appropriate HTML 5 elements.
* Modify the javascript file (_js/script.js) to locate the user's location and add a map under the "your location" section.

PS: To test geo-location, you have to either post your files to a server, e.g. I-School server (and test it online) or set up a local server (and test it locally).
